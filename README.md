# kioku-express

Express end point.

# Setting up and installing

First, run `npm install` on this directory.

After that, go ahead and create a `.env` file in kioku-express. 

Inside there, it expects a `DB_LINK` variable to be set.

### Sample .env
```
# .env
DB_LINKDB_LINK=mongodb+srv://...
```

You can acquire the URL from any Mongo server. In our case, we use mongodb+srv since we are hosting the MongoDB on Atlas (thanks to its free tier).
